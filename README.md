# Control-Test
A test repo for reporting bugs.

Currently hosts an UWP that reproduces [Windows UI Library #15](https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/15).

## How to reproduce:
1. Clone with [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/)
2. Publish to your phone.
3. Click on the `Add` button.
4. A `ContentDialog` hosting a broken `ColorPicker` control will show up.
